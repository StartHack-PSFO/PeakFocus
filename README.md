# PeakFocus

> Hackathon project at START Hack 2023

... is a mobile app that allows athletes to train their **focus in the most important moments** of their game. Many athletes internalize a *routine* to achieve and maintain focus during competitions. Our solution improves the training of these routines by providing feedback from a brain interface. More specifically, athletes are challenged to reduce the volume of a control sound through staying in a *focused state of mind* (which we measure via their brain activity) while doing their routine. The result is a more achievable, robust and retainable routine.
