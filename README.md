# PEAKFocus

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** this branch was only used to produce a demonstration video of our application _after_ the actual Hackathon as we did not do so during the event. In contrast to the data in the actual hackathon were every data was coming from actual live brain EEG, the data in the demo video is simulated as we did not had access to brainboost's devices anymore.
